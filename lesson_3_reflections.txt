Reflections for Lesson 3


1st reflection
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to have an online repository
When you want to share with others
When you want to collaborate on projects.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones on Github. clones are copies of repositories. Branches are used to split code/work into streams
to enable experimentation and features etc.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually controlling the sync will give you the ability to determine which commits and changes you want on your local repository and give you veto rights on the contents of the local repository.
