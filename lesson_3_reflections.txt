Reflections for Lesson 3


1st reflection
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to have an online repository
When you want to share with others
When you want to collaborate on projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually controlling the sync will give you the ability to determine which commits and changes you want on your local repository and give you veto rights on the contents of the local repository.
