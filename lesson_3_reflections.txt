Reflections for Lesson 3


1st reflection
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to have an online repository
When you want to share with others
When you want to collaborate on projects.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones on Github. clones are copies of repositories. Branches are used to split code/work into streams
to enable experimentation and features etc.
